# Decision-Making Model Using Rough Sets and Soft Sets

## Overview
This project presents a decision-making model designed to address uncertainties in data, often encountered in real-life scenarios (Here we taken the institution data). Traditional methods like fuzzy sets, rough sets, and soft sets each have their own limitations in managing ambiguous information. To overcome these restrictions, this model introduces a hybrid approach that utilizes rough sets on intuitionistic fuzzy approximation spaces for pre-processing and soft sets for post-processing, resulting in an effective decision-making solution.

## Features
- **Pre-Processing (Rough Sets on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Approximation Spaces):** 
  - Handles data ambiguities by extracting nearly equivalent classes.
  
- **Post-Processing (Soft Sets):** 
  - Enhances decision-making by utilizing soft set theory to evaluate pre-processed data.
  
- **Application:** 
  - Tested on institutional datasets, showcasing the model's practicality in addressing uncertainties and delivering reliable decisions.

## Methodology
1. **Pre-Process:**
   - The pre-processing stage leverages rough sets on intuitionistic fuzzy approximation spaces to approximate classes based on nearly similar attributes.
   
2. **Post-Process:**
   - In the post-processing stage, soft sets are employed to support decision-making by evaluating the nearly equivalent classes from the pre-processing stage.

## Dataset
The model has been tested using an institutional dataset taken from India Today website consists of Management institutions in India (sample data of 10 Institutions), demonstrating its ability to handle ambiguous information and produce accurate decisions.

## Results
The proposed decision-making model has been shown to be practical in real-world scenarios. Testing on an institutional dataset revealed that the model effectively handles uncertainties and ambiguities, offering a robust solution for decision-making.

## Future Work
Future developments could focus on:
- Enhancing the efficiency of the model for larger datasets.
- Extending the model to handle a wider variety of data types and uncertainty sources.
